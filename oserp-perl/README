NAME
	oserp - stands for OpenSource Emailer Replaces Pine
	A work-alike replacement for pine, with a GPL compatable license.

THIS VERSION IS A SIMPLE PROOF OF CONCEPT VERSION
	to get a pine clone out the door that can be distributed under a
	GPL compliant license.

REASON FOR CREATING YET ANOTHER MAIL CLIENT:
I like pine. I like pine a lot. I don't like the license that pine uses,
and pine is missing some features I'd like to see.
mutt isn't bad, but the features I'd like to see have been suggested and
discouraged, people have tried writing hacks for them and failed, and I
don't want to be yet another person on that list of people.
I know perl really well. perl has a lot of mail handling modules and
scripts already out there. I don't think it will be very difficult to tie
them together to create a full blown client.

And, maybe someday, it can be re-written in C, or C++, which would be a good
way for me to learn C/C++. GNU MailUtils already exists, so the backend
structure is basically there (though it's also missing some of the features
I'd like to see, but that can be extended).
Hydrant (http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/hydrant) was started with similar
goals to mine, but uses MailUtils, but it's dormant, so I'll probably try to
contribute to that down the road.


USAGE
	Currently, the mail folder path is hardcoded, and there is no config
	support yet. So, it reads the file "./inbox". This will change soon.
	To run it, cd to a directory that has an mbox file named "inbox".
	Type:
		perl oserp
	The rest should be just like pine, except most of the features don't
	work yet.


REQUIRES
	curses or ncurses (c library)
	Curses (perl module)
	Curses::Widgets (perl module)
	POSIX (perl module - I want to remove the need for this)
	Mail::Box::Manager (perl module)

	RECOMMENDED
		MIME::Types (perl module)
		Mail::Box::Parser::C (perl module - faster file based mail access)

FEATURES
	Mail::Box currently supports folders of type:
		Dbx (read only) outlook folders
		IMAP4 (under development)
		Maildir
		Mbox
		MH
		POP3 (read/delete only)
	GUI - currently, only a Curses interface that clones pine.
		Main index works.
		Message listing works.
			Most movement keys works (<,>,KEY_PGUP,KEY_UP,etc)
			Jump works
		Message display works (text only right now)
		Compose works (attachments even work, but no file browser).
		Send mail works
		Few, if any, of the editor functions work, and field movements in
		compose don't all work.

TODO
	Program structure needs re-done.
