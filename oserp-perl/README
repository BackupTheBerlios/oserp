oserp - stands for OpenSource Emailer Replaces Pine. A work-alike replacement for pine, with a GPL compatable license.


Reason for creating yet another mail client:
I like pine. I like pine a lot. I don't like the license that pine uses, and pine is missing some features I'd like to see.
mutt isn't bad, but the features I'd like to see have been suggested and discouraged, people have tried writing hacks for them and failed, and I don't want to be yet another person on that list of people.
I know perl really well. perl has a lot of mail handling modules and scripts already out there. I don't think it will be very difficult to tie them together to create a full blown client.
