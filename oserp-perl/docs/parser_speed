Thesea are testing speeds for arsing a 1,099,526 byte mbox file, containing
800 messages, on a P3 500 running FreeBSD 4.8-STABLE.

Using: Mail::Box::Parser::Perl (part of the Mail::Box distribution)
	4.43 seconds
Using: Mail::Box::Parser::C    (available separately on CPAN)
	3.52 seconds

This hasn't been tested very thoroughly but, from what I can tell, creating
all the Mail::Box::Message objects takes a long time.

I very simple parser I wrote consumed only a fraction of 1 second to 
parse the same file, extracing all message headers, storing tehm in an
array of arrays.


So... I think a different backend would be worth checking out.
